# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- **Security fix: the auth challenge transcript now binds `username`.**
  Previously `transcript = SHA-256("wsh-v1\0" || session_id || nonce || channelBinding)`
  never covered the username at all — a signature said nothing about which
  identity it was presented under. Now:
  `transcript = SHA-256("wsh-v1\0" || lp(username) || lp(session_id) || nonce || channelBinding)`,
  where `lp()` is a 4-byte big-endian length prefix on the two
  variable-length string fields (needed so concatenation can't collide).
  **Breaking**: `buildTranscript`/`signChallenge`/`verifyChallenge` now
  take an options object (`{ username, channelBinding }`) instead of a
  positional `channelBinding` argument.
- Fixed the codegen script (`spec/codegen.mjs`) to resolve its two-repo
  output paths correctly (JS in this repo, Rust in the companion server
  repo) instead of the stale vendored-layout paths.

## 0.0.0

- **Renamed: `wsh-upon-star` is now `@johnhenry/wsh`, restarting at 0.0.0.**
  Same library, same API — a shorter name, a new address, a new version era.
  Previously published as `wsh-upon-star` (last release 0.1.1), now
  deprecated. The GitHub repo moved to `github.com/johnhenry/wsh` (the old
  path redirects).

  ```sh
  npm install @johnhenry/wsh
  ```

  Docs: https://opensource.johnhenry.me/wsh/. The 0.0.0 is a deliberate
  restart on import, not a maturity signal.


## 0.1.0 (2026-03-15)
